# Podman basics - Define, build and modify container images

## 1 : Create a Dockerfile to deploy an Apache HTTP Server which hosts a custom main page

```bash

```

## 2 : Build and see how many layers the image consists of

```bash
```

## 3 : Run the image locally, inspect its status and logs, finally test that it responds as expected

```bash
```

## 4 : Run a command inside the pod to print out the index.html file

```bash
```

## 5 : Tag the image with ip and port of a private local registry and then push the image to this registry

```bash
```

## 6 : Verify that the registry contains the pushed image and that you can pull it

```bash
```

## 7 : Run a pod with the image pushed to the registry

```bash
```

## 8 : Log into a remote registry server and then read the credentials from the default file

```bash
```

## 9 : Create a secret both from existing login credentials and from the CLI

```bash
```

## 10 : Create the manifest for a Pod that uses one of the two secrets just created to pull an image hosted on the relative private remote registry

```bash
```

## 11 : Clean up all the images and containers

```bash
```
