## Exercices to work for the CKAD certification

The repository contains the note I took about the [CKAD Exercises](https://github.com/dgkanatsios/CKAD-exercises) proposed by Dimitris-Ilias Gkanatsios.


Also additional practical cases to be totally ready for the exam day.

To create a local Kubernetes cluster, you can [use Kind](https://dev.to/jdxlabs/a-local-kubernetes-cluster-in-seconds-with-kind-31lc).
